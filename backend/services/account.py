"""
backend/services/account.py

Manages creation, update, deletion, and retrieval of Accounts.
In a double-entry environment, each Account can appear in many LedgerEntry lines
(e.g. for 'MAIN_IN', 'MAIN_OUT', 'FEE'). The user typically calls these endpoints
via account.py router.

Now refactored to:
 - Auto-create four special accounts if missing: 
   ID=1 => Bank (USD)
   ID=2 => Wallet (BTC)
   ID=3 => Exchange USD (USD)
   ID=4 => Exchange BTC (BTC)
 - Disallow name or currency changes for those four special accounts.
 - Provide an option for normal accounts beyond those four.
