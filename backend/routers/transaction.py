"""
backend/routers/transaction.py

Router for Transaction endpoints in a full double-entry environment.
The user might still pass single-entry fields (from_account_id, amount, etc.),
but the service transforms them into LedgerEntries plus optional BTC lot usage.

We keep these endpoints minimal, delegating actual multi-line ledger creation,
BTC lot tracking (BitcoinLot), and disposal (LotDisposal) to the service layer.

Refactor Notes:
 - Added 'test_*' endpoints as examples of how to create specific deposit/transfer
   transactions for testing or demonstration. These are marked "temporary" so you
   know they don't have to remain in production if you prefer to keep a single
   generic POST /api/transactions for everything.
 - Retained existing create/list/update/delete endpoints as your primary interface.
 - Provided extensive docstrings to clarify usage for new developers.
